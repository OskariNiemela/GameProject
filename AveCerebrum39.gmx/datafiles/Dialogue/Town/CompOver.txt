Oh.. This road is the only way out of this town, we need to get rid of the blockage in order to continue our journey.
Maybe we could ask around and see if someone will help us in getting rid of it, or maybe there's someone we can ask to get rid of it for us.

So. Are you having fun on your adventure?
We'll talk to the mayor soon enough, and then we'll be on our way.

Could we perhaps borrow some equipment, and get rid of the boulder ourselves?

A key, this could help us find something to move that rock with.

This must be where they keep all the equipment, maybe we'll find a drill or something to break up that rock.
